Dear Dr. Haghighi, how do you do?
 
As detailed in our proposal, we will be sending two monthly progress reports. In the October report, we outline the general tasks that have been completed-to-date, discuss current tasks being worked on, and provide a forecast of the work that needs to be completed.
 
Tasks Completed To-Date:
- Data has been cleaned and formatted
- Built a model for forecasting flight delays given an origin-destination pair and scheduled time of departure
- Gridded our space into 2x2 chunks

Current Tasks: 
- Creating a probability distribution for all flights using historical data relative to their actual departure time

Next Steps:
- Creating a 36x72x288 matrix using the probability distribution created for each flight
- Validating our model using 80% of flights and taking the remaining 20% to compare the probablity distributions for each.
- Visualization of results
 
We appreciate your continued interest in this project and look forward to hearing back from you.
 
Regards,
 
Patrick, Vatya, Smit, and Dhruv
