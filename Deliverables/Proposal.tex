\noindent \theshortclient, \newl 
Thank you for providing a course-based consulting experience for the students of MAT 4376G Topics in Statistics (Introduction to Quantitative Consulting), offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Ottawa during the 2019 Fall Term. \newl 
This project will help them bridge the gap between theory and applications of mathematical, statistical, and analytical methods. Under my supervision, the students will work in small teams and treat this mock project as a real-world consulting opportunity, \textbf{with the caveat that no contractual obligation exists between your organization and the University}. \newl In particular, while the team will strive to provide useful and actionable insights into your problem, the University makes no guarantee that the project will be successful and, consequently, will not charge a fee for services rendered. Telesat, on the other hand, will retain all IP generated \textit{via} this project related to satellite communication applications.

\section{Background}
Telesat is a global leader in satellite operation, providing reliable and secure satellite-delivered communications solutions worldwide. They provide high value expertise and support to industry participants on a global basis. Telesat owns 16 GEO satellites, the Canadian payload on ViaSat-1 and one Phase 1 LEO satellite which is the start of Telesat’s planned advanced global LEO satellite constellation that will offer ultra-low latency, extremely high throughput, affordable broadband services.\par
Telesat is launching a state-of-the-art satellite constellation of highly advanced satellites in low-earth-orbit (LEO) that will seamlessly integrate with terrestrial networks. The global network will deliver fiber quality throughput anywhere on earth. This is a highly flexible system that dynamically allocates capacity where there’s demand, thus maximizing system efficiency. This is a future-proof solution to backhaul cellular traffic, and to provide high-speed broadband access to planes, ships and remote enterprise and government users. Capacity will be available as layer-2 connectivity for service providers to connect their end users.
\section{Objectives and Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide advanced knowledge of the flight routes over the European Corridor, including the latitude and longitude position of an aircraft that is planned to receive service from the satellites, through forecasts and time-weighted probability distribution for each circular coverage area
\item Provide visualization representing flight routes and density, including heat maps/flame charts for the circular coverage area to help with easily interpretation and use of the analysis provided
\end{itemize}
\section{Methodology}
The tasks to be undertaken for analysis are outlined below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Data Collection} -- we will be getting data from Telesat and other online sources, and possibly merging multiple data sets to improve predictions;
    \item \textit{Data Cleaning and Formatting} -- we will review the data on flight history, cleanse and format it to meet the requirements of our alagorithms;
    \item \textit{Analysis and Modeling of Data} -- we will analyze the data using time-series algorithms and machine learning methods to predict the location of each flight. Our analysis will account for statistical dependencies of each coverage area and the final model will be able to predict the density for each coverage region;
    \item \textit{Visualisation of Results} -- we will provide visualisations of our analysis representing flight routes and density, including heat maps/flame charts for the circular regions, and
    \item \textit{Documentation of Findings} -- we Will create a short report detailing the results obtained above and provide a dashboard.
\end{itemize}
%- suggest a series of steps / methods that you will follow (see samples); the idea is to show the client that you have already started thinking about their problem\\
%- add caveat that the data will ultimately be driving what method is used 
\section{Milestones and Deliverables}
The following deliverables will be provided to Telesat:
\begin{itemize}
    \item monthly progress reports providing updates on completed tasks;
    \item code for time-series analysis and other analysis of data (R, Python, or other, TBD);
    \item final report containing findings and conclusions, and
    \item dashboard to report findings of interest.
\end{itemize}
\section{Schedules and Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Progress Reports} - Oct 31, Nov 30
    \item \textbf{Final Report} - Dec 21
    \item \textbf{Dashboard} - Dec 21
\end{itemize}
Provided that this proposal is agreed to by October 10, 2019, we expect the project to be completed by December 21. Unexpected circumstances may require adjustments to this schedule. Should there be a change in scope and/or level of effort required, the timeline will be modified accordingly through agreement with Telesat. If we are unable to complete a task in time, we will inform Telesat as soon as possible in order to re-organize the project’s priorities.

\section{Resources and Costs}
The team assigned to this project consists of Dr.\ Patrick Boily (team lead), Vatya Kashore, Smit Patel, and Dhruv Pramod (undergraduate students in statistics with strong analytical and problem-solving skills). The work will be completed using open-source software (R, Python, etc.). We do not anticipate any need to travel for this project, although we suggest setting up a few meetings with Telesat to clarify questions relating to domain expertise, modeling approaches, and the available data. 
\newl As this project is a mandatory component for the course \textit{MAT 4376E Introduction to Quantitative Consulting}, the client will not be charged for any work completed -- the total projected cost is thus nil. Note that this arrangement is only applicable within the context of the course and not necessarily applicable to extensions of this work or future work with Telesat. 
\section{Invoicing}
A mock invoice (with a total cost of 0\$) will be sent upon completion of the project, for your records.

Based on the estimated time and effort, the total cost associated with this project would would be \$14,250 (+ HST), at an hourly rate of \$60/hour for students (150 hours) and \$175/hour for myself (30 hours). Since this project is course work for MAT 4376E, the cost to Telesat is \$0.
