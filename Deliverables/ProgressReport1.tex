\section{Introduction}
In this short progress report, we list the general tasks that have been completed to-date, discuss current tasks being worked on, and clarify details of the project

\section{Completed Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight path data collection for prototype model is complete
\item Cleaning of flight path data for the prototype model is complete
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Currently working on building prototype model by using flight path data from two intersecting flight paths[London to Munich and Berlin to Paris]
    \item Working on collecting climate data for the area being covered. We have tried multiple sources including a naval database in order to gather climate data but access to these files is proving to be a challenge. If the client can provide such data for the area being covered it would increase the accuracy of the prototype
\end{itemize}

\section{Questions and Clarifications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is there any flight path data being sent from the client? We are limited in the amount of data we can collect. If the client can provide such data, it can be used to train the prototype model and increase overall accuracy. 
\end{itemize}
